a platform doing PU learning with Rochio/Spy/SVM/EM. Could be useful.

TODO list:

TODO: Explore SVM/Rocchio as a third possibility and the papers written by Bing Liu. ICDM03 explains it. IN ADDITION to 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, it is the crucial work in the area of PU learning!!

TODO: Explore the Iterative Bayes algorithm, the whole idea of bootstrapping Bayesian sets.

TODO: Potential negative effects of PN learning and cases when PU might be a superior approach


TODO: LGN algorithm, Bing, 2007, suggests using artificial negatives as an alternative in training the NB classifier in S-EM?? IJCAI-07

http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview/id/225316.html seems like a good discussion of various IR techniques


IJCAI11 provides even further guidance on this front....


Classifier4J for Java seems to be something that would be adequate for implementing the NB-based PU learning algorithms

Letham, growing a list - recommended by Zoubin, READ!!!
